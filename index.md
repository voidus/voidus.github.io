# voyd's lab notes

These are my notes when experimenting with stuff.
It's mostly for me, but I'm putting it online in case it is useful for other people.

If you have feedback, ideas, thoughts or rants, I'd love to hear them at [the github discussions page](https://github.com/voidus/voidus.github.io/discussions)

[[z:zettels?tag=project]]
