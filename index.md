# voyd's lab notes

These are my notes when experimenting with stuff.
It's mostly for me, but I'm putting it online in case it is useful for other people.

If you have feedback, ideas, thoughts or rants, I'd love to hear them at [the github discussions page](https://github.com/voidus/voidus.github.io/discussions)

[[z:zettels?tag=project]]

## Pending projects, yet to be described

- Distributed Wiki using zero-trust nomadic infrastructure and CRDTs
  - Secure Scuttlebutt as a transport?
  - LSEQ-undo with the formatting enhancements from that recent paper as a base?
  - If scuttlebutt provides causality for each log, is that enough?
    - inventing the transport again is futile, so it better be
  - https://reitermk.github.io/papers/1995/CJ.pdf (not sure if this is needed?)
- Distributed library
