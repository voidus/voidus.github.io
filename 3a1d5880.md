# Export certificates for browsers

We've been handling certificates in the [pem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail)
format, but browsers and other applications usually require
[pkcs12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12).
We can do the conversion using openssl:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -export \
    -out certs/foo.p12 \
    -in certs/foo.pem \
    -inkey certs/foo-key.pem \
    -name foo.clients.pki.your.domain.tld \
    -certfile intermediate/intermediate-01.pem \
    -certfile ca/ca.pem
```

This will create `certs/foo.p12`, which applications seem to load.
