# Generating a certificate chain

When entities present certificates, the other party needs to verify the full chain from the root
certificate, which it already has, to the leaf certificate.
In practice, this means that the client also needs to present intermediate certificates.

Because of this, certificates are usually handled in bundles (I think that's the term), and they
seem to usually have a `.crt` file extension.

As far as I can tell, cfssl provides multiple tools to do this, but I couldn't get them to work.
That's not an issue though, because certificate bundles are simple concatenations of the
certificates:

```shell
cat certs/foo.pem intermediate/intermediate-01.pem > certs/foo.crt
```

Including the root certificate is optional. I'm not sure if it makes a difference and couldn't tell
which way is more robust.
